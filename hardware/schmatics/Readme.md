# Schematics

This directory contains the schematics for the ATmega328P-based microcontroller project.

## Files

- `atmega328p_schematic.sch`: The original schematic file in [EAGLE](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview) format.
- `atmega328p_schematic.pdf`: A PDF version of the schematic for easy viewing.
- `images/`: Contains images of the schematic overview and component layout for quick reference.

## Viewing the Schematics

### EasyEDA Format

The original schematic file is provided in EasyEDA format. You can open and edit this file using the EAGLE PCB design software.

1. Download and install [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com/page/download).
2. Open the `atmega328p_schematic.sch` file in EasyEDA.

### PDF Format

For those who do not have EasyEDA, the schematic is also available as a PDF:

- [atmega328p_schematic.pdf](Schematic_atmega.pdf)

### Images

Quick reference images of the schematic and component layout are available in the `images` directory:

## Modifying the Schematics

To modify the schematics:

1. Open the `atmega328p_schematic.sch` file in EasyEDA.
2. Make the necessary changes.
3. Save the updated schematic.

If you make significant changes, consider updating the PDF and images to reflect the latest design.
